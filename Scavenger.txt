SC4-VGR Bots
SC4-VGR Bots are a special type of robot that only appear after enemy level 100 is reached. SC4-VGR Bots have a random chance of spawning in the map shortly after the grace period ends, the chance increasing as the enemy level goes up. Only one SC4-VGR Bot can spawn per stage.
SC4-VGR Bots spawn with a random assortment of items equipped. They will spawn with the following:
- 6 random types of Normal items - each with 12 stacks
- 3 random types of Genuine items - each with 6 stacks
- 1 random Unusual type item (20% chance) with 1 stack
- A random Strange item

The number of stacks per item that they spawn with and the chance for them to spawn with an Unusual item increases as the enemy level goes up.

Behavior
SC4-VGR Bots are not on Blue team and can damage and kill other robots with their attacks, triggering any On Kill item effects they may have. They can also collect money from killed robots. Every once in a while, if they have the money, they will attempt to scout the map for a crate, opening the crate and taking the item if they can afford it. They can also pick up items dropped through any other means. Upon death, the SC4-VGR will drop one of each unique item type that they have around the location that they were killed, as well as any items that they picked up.
SC4-VGR bots will spawn with a random weapon chosen from the following:
- Rocket Launcher (may also be Direct Hit or Beggar's Bazooka instead)
- Grenade Launcher (may be Iron Bomber or Loch-n-Load instead)
- Boots + Tide Turner + Persian Persuader
- Dragon's Fury
